<h2>Instagram</h2>
<h3> How Instagram Has Evolved Over The Past Few Years?</h3>
<p>About two years ago, Instagram was a platform where people could post an abundance of photos to share with their followers. In addition, privacy policies are manditory to have so no hackers are able to access your account which is why today you can accept only certain people to follow you. Overtime, Instagram has quickly become one of the safest platforms.
  <h4>Are There Too Many Features On Instagram?</h4>
  Unlike any other Platform Instagram has multiple features including: IGTV (where people can constantly post videos with no time duration), Boomarangs (videos that loop back and forth for a couple of seconds), Live videos (where you can go live for as long as you desire and only your followers can see), and other features that can easily be accessed with no effort while other platforms require a tremendous amount of effort. So yes there are a wide variety of features maybe a little more than most platforms but now a days these features are frequently used more which is why its easier to have them on one app instead of hundreds.
  <h5>Is Instagram Similar To Snapchat?</h5>
  <p>The main purpose of Snapchat is to share snaps with your friends, Instagram is pretty similar because you can share stories with your followers. Although, Instagram has recently been used a lot more due to the new features.</p>
